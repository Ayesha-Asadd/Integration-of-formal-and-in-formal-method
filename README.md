### 📘 Formal and Informal Methods Applied Report – GrocerStore Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and documentation report based on the **GrocerStore** project originally developed in C++ to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

📌 **Project Origin**: [GrocerStore Repository by Fahad Jameel](https://github.com/Fahad-Jameel/GrocerStore)

### 📄 What This Report Covers

This report showcases how **formal** and **informal** methods were applied throughout the software development lifecycle of the GrocerStore project—from requirement gathering to final deployment. It includes:

#### ✅ **Informal Methods**:

* Requirements analysis
* Functional specifications
* Architecture and system flow description
* User stories and use case discussion

#### ✅ **Formal Methods**:

* UML Diagrams (Sequence, Activity, Class)
* Formal specification (Z-Notation, Algebraic Spec)
* Logical verification through truth tables
* Model checking and validation techniques

### 🔍 Contributors & Roles

Each team member contributed to a dedicated section:

* Member 1: Project Overview & Functional Flow
* Member 2: UML Modeling
* Member 3: Formal Analysis of Code
* Member 4: Truth Tables & Logical Validations
* Member 5: Final Documentation & Integration of Methods

### 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how the integration of formal and informal methods enhances software quality by ensuring **correctness**, **reliability**, **user-friendliness**, and **maintainability**.
